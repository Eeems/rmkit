## About

DumbSkull (short for Dungeon Scoundrel) is a card based dungeon crawler.

It has two game modes: **Donsol** and **Scoundrel**.

## Rules

Each room you go to has 4 cards. In Scoundrel, you must use 3 of the cards to
move to the next room, leaving the last card for the next room. In Donsol, you
must use all 4 cards to go to the next room.

There are 3 types of cards: Health Potions, Shields and Monsters.

**Health Potions** heal you up to a maximum of 21 Health. In Scoundrel, you can
only drink one health potion per room. In Donsol, you can not drink 2 potions
in a row, as the second will have no effect.

**Shields** will reduce the damage of a monster. You can only use a shield on a
lesser monster than the last, otherwise the shield will break and you will take
full damage.

**Monsters** do their indicated damage to you, minus any shield reduction.

If the room is too difficult, you may **flee** by shuffling the cards to the
bottom of the deck. You may only flee if you haven't fled the previous room.
You may always flee the first room in the dungeon until you make a move.

The game ends when you reach 0 life or use all the cards in the deck.
